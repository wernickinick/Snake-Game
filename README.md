## 🚀 Features

- Smooth and responsive movement  
- Randomized food spawning  
- Score tracking during gameplay  
- Colorful 3D style tiles  
- Game over screen  

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or above).  
2. Compile and run the program starting with `Snake.java`.

```bash
javac Game.java Snake.java
java Snake
```

This will create a game window with a playable Snake game.

## 📷 Assets

  - `Image/Background copy.png`  Used as the background for the game board  

## 📌 Future Plans

I would like to:

- [ ] Add a **main menu** to start the game, view instructions, and exit  
- [ ] Implement **high score tracking**, saving to and loading from a file   
- [ ] Include sound effects or background music 🎶
